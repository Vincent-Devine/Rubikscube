<br /><hr />

## **Commands/Buttons :**
- Size Slider : Allow to change rubikscube's size after clicking on reset values
- Mix Complexity Slider : Define the number of mixing moves done
- Reset Values Button : Restart with the defined config (Size and Mix Complexity) if there is no movement already being done

- Zoom/Dezoom : Scroll with mouse

HOW TO CHOOSE AND ROTATE A FACE:
To select which face will be moved, the user must click on one cube. To decide the direction, he must move (with the click still pressed) to a neighbouring cube. ATTENTION : The user must finsih on a cube otherwise the rotation won't work. 

## Hardest Part :
- Defining and selecting faces
